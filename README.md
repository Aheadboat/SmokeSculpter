Smoke Sculptor is a real-time 3D smoke simulation written in three.js using the Eulerian method. 

## Controls
- `Left click and drag` to rotate camera
- `Right click and drag` to move camera horizontally
- `Left click and hold` to add smoke (when mouse is above the rendering cube)
- `Scroll` to zoom in/out
- `Space` to reset camera
- `R` to reset simulation
- `N` to add Object where the mouse is [TODO]

## Developement 

`npm install` to install dependencies

`npm run dev` to start dev server

`npm run build` to build project for production and export to `docs/demo/` folder for github pages
